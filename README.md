# CS255---SystemAnalysisAndDesign

### Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

Liam and Ian wanted to create a Learning Management System (LMS) for new drivers that could help prepare them for their transition into a driver's license.

### What did you do particularly well?

Take note of the fine details during the interview and requirements process for functionalities others may have missed.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The Use Case Diagram, I didn't want it to be too busy so I left out a few details and interactions within the system, but it seems to have been missing important parts comparatively to other peers.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I imagined what I would like to see as a user of the system and mentally walked myself through all the interactions of how it would be used and what may be needed.

### How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I ask myself a question and with every answer I ask myself a question about that answer until I can't think of any more questions.

I think paying close attention to the details and reviewing notes multiple times over different periods can really help you understand what the client wants and the flaws in your previous thinking.
